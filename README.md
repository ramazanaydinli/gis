Geographic Information System (GIS) works


3d_rotation: As the name suggests, file takes input and rotates it, giving back result coordinates
ramer-douglas-peucker: calculating rdp algoritm from the points taken from notepad (.txt) input file
transformation_cartesian_to_ellipsoidal: takes cartesian coordinates and calculates ellipsoidal coordinates according to wgs-84
transformation_global2local_ellipsoidal: takes the cartesian coordinates of two different points and calculates global ellipsoidal coordinates and after that converts it to local ellipsoidal coordinates, givig azimuth angle, zenith angle and slant range
